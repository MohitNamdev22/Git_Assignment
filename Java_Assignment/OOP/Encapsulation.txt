Q) Explain the concept of encapsulation with a suitable example.

=> Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data attributes and methods into a single enpsulated using which is a class and restricting direct access to the data by making the attributes private. To access the data, public methods such as getter and setter are used.

Importance of Encapsulation - 
1. Data Hiding - It prevents the direct access to data
2. Control - It allows validation and logic to be added to data modification.
3. Flexibility - In this internal implementation can be changed without affecting other part of program.

Example - 

class Student {
    private String name;
    private int rollNumber;
    private double marks;

    public Student(String name, int rollNumber, double marks) {
        this.name = name;
        this.rollNumber = rollNumber;
        this.marks = marks;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getRollNumber() {
        return rollNumber;
    }

    public double getMarks() {
        return marks;
    }

    public void setMarks(double marks) {
        if(marks >= 0 && marks <= 100) {
            this.marks = marks;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid marks");
        }
    }
}
